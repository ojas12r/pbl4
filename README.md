Market Regime Detection using Hidden Markov Models


Overview
Financial markets are non-stationary and alternate between different regimes such as:

Bull Markets
Bear Markets
High Volatility Periods
Low Volatility Periods

Traditional trading strategies assume constant market behavior, which leads to poor performance during regime shifts.

This project uses a 3-State Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect hidden market regimes and enhance a Simple Moving Average (SMA) trading strategy using regime-based filtering.
